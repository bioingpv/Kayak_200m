# Kayak_200m

8 college level athtles used two paddle blade models (Alpa and Gamma) and were randomly assigned to the two groups that first used one model or the other. All trials were recorded on the same day.
Four trials for each wing model on each subject: two upstream and two downstream alternating runs, for a total of 64 trials over the eight subjects. In order to minimize the effect of fatigue on the paddling technique and on the power output of each paddler, we chose to record 200m trials, each lasting less than a minute , and with a pause of at least five minutes between subsequent trials. 
All subjects were asked to focus on producing the best paddling technique and maximum power with each stroke while keeping a rate of 75 strokes per minute (spm) specified using a metronome sound through their headphones.
